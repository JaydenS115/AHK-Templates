- ### **Single-File with Utility**
  - *(not intended for new learners)*
  - Clean, organized layout in a **single file**
  - Easy-to-use **utilities** integrated into the script
    - with full comments and consistent styling
  - Pre-listed **sections** for Global Constructs, Main Script, & Function/Subroutine Definitions
  - Setting Initialization moved out of the way at the end of the file
    - but still **auto-executed** (using GoSub commands)
